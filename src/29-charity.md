The surplus you have is not entirely yours.

This is a claim worth sitting with before accepting or rejecting. You have what you have through a combination of effort, talent, circumstance, and luck — and the relative contribution of each is genuinely difficult to calculate, but it is not zero for any of them. The infrastructure you moved through, the stability you were raised in, the education you received, the connections that opened the doors — none of these were produced by you alone. To the extent that your surplus exceeds what your effort alone would have generated, you are holding something that was partly built by others, and the obligation to return some portion of it is not a guilt trip. It is an accounting.

The distinction between optional generosity and structured responsibility matters. Optional generosity is giving when it feels good, when the cause is appealing, when the act of giving produces visible social affirmation. It is giving that costs nothing in the deeper sense — nothing is rearranged, nothing is foregone, the gift is made from what is abundant. Structured responsibility is giving that is decided in advance, that continues when the emotional pull is absent, that is calibrated to actual capacity rather than to feeling. The difference is not in the amount but in the architecture. One is a mood. The other is a practice.

The obligation is proportional to capacity, and this is important because it prevents both excessive guilt and comfortable inaction. You are not obligated to give what you don't have. You are obligated to give in proportion to what you do have, which means that as capacity increases, the obligation increases with it. The person with genuine surplus who gives at the level of the person with marginal surplus is not being modest. They are being stingy with the accounting dressed up as virtue.

How you give matters as much as whether you give. Sympathy-driven giving — responding to the most emotionally compelling presentation of a problem — is not reliably effective, and in some cases actively produces harm by sustaining systems that are less efficient than alternatives. The fact that an image is moving, that a cause has personal resonance, that the ask comes from someone you like — none of these are strong evidence that your contribution will produce meaningful change. Giving effectively requires some willingness to be rational about impact: to ask whether the organization is competent, whether the intervention has evidence behind it, whether the money will be used well.

This is not an argument for emotional detachment from the suffering of others. The emotional response is appropriate and motivating. The argument is that stopping at the emotion — giving because it felt urgent in the moment, to whoever asked most compellingly — is not the same as giving well. You can care deeply and still think carefully about where the care, once translated into action, will do the most.

There is a specific failure mode in charitable giving that is worth naming: giving in ways that primarily serve the giver's self-image. This is giving as a performance of generosity — the donation that is made publicly, the volunteer trip whose social documentation exceeds its actual impact, the charity that is chosen for its cultural prestige rather than its effectiveness. None of this is better than nothing, exactly, but it is not what the obligation requires. The obligation is not to feel like a generous person. It is to produce some actual improvement in the circumstances of others, at real cost to yourself.

The real cost part is essential. Giving that costs nothing does not demonstrate that you value others' welfare over your own comfort. It demonstrates that you value both equally when they don't conflict. The latter is a significantly weaker claim. What you actually believe is revealed by what you give when giving requires genuine sacrifice — when you are forgoing something real, not something marginal.

Decide what you will give before the circumstances that prompt giving arrive. This is the structural move that converts generosity from a mood into a practice. Set the number. Commit to it. Review it as capacity changes. Then give that amount, consistently, to causes you have chosen on the basis of evidence rather than emotion. This is not the end of generosity, and it does not prevent additional giving when something moves you. It is the floor — the portion that is not optional because you decided, in a clear moment, that it was not.
