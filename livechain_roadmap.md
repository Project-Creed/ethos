# LiveChain Mesh: Implementation Roadmap and PoC Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a phased implementation roadmap for developing and deploying a decentralized multistreaming solution based on the **LiveChain Mesh** architecture. The goal is to build a resilient, scalable, and cost-effective platform that overcomes the limitations of traditional, centralized multistreaming setups.

This roadmap is designed for a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) and subsequent pilot program, with a focus on validating the core technical assumptions and demonstrating the viability of the architecture before a full-scale production rollout.

## 2. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Goals & Success Criteria

The primary objective of the PoC is to validate the foundational components of the LiveChain Mesh architecture.

**Success Criteria:**

*   **SC1: Successful End-to-End Stream:** A single broadcaster can successfully stream a 1080p/30fps feed through one transcoding edge node to at least two simultaneous destinations (e.g., YouTube and Twitch).
*   **SC2: Latency Target:** The average end-to-end latency from broadcaster to final destination must be below **200ms**.
*   **SC3: P2P Network Stability:** The Lattica P2P overlay network, consisting of at least 4 nodes (1 broadcaster, 1 edge node, 2 viewers), maintains stable connectivity for a continuous 1-hour stream with no more than 1% packet loss.
*   **SC4: Smart Contract Interaction:** The `StreamRegistry.sol` smart contract, deployed on a public testnet (Polygon Amoy), correctly registers and updates the status of the live stream.
*   **SC5: Transcoding Validation:** The GPU-enabled edge node must successfully transcode the incoming RTMP stream into the required format for the final destinations without introducing significant artifacts (maintaining a VMAF score of â‰¥ 90).

## 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk Category         | Description                                                                                             | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Risk**    | The Lattica P2P library, being a relatively new technology, may have undiscovered bugs or performance limitations. | Medium     | High   | **Mitigation:** Allocate extra time in Phase 1 for thorough testing and benchmarking. Engage with the Lattica developer community for support. Develop a contingency plan to use a more established P2P library (e.g., libp2p) if major issues arise. |
| **Economic Risk**     | The `STREAM` token's value may be volatile, making the incentive model unpredictable and potentially unattractive for node operators. | High       | Medium | **Mitigation:** Initially, peg the `STREAM` reward value to a stablecoin (e.g., USDC) to guarantee predictable earnings for node operators. Introduce a governance model in a later phase to allow the community to vote on reward parameters. |
| **Execution Risk**    | The 3-month timeline is ambitious and could be delayed by unforeseen technical challenges or resource constraints. | Medium     | Medium | **Mitigation:** Adopt an agile development approach with weekly sprints and regular reviews. Prioritize core features and be prepared to de-scope non-essential items to meet deadlines. Maintain a buffer in the project budget for unexpected costs. |
| **Adoption Risk**     | Broadcasters and viewers may be hesitant to adopt a new, decentralized platform due to a lack of awareness or trust. | Medium     | High   | **Mitigation:** During the pilot program, actively engage with a small group of influential creators to gather feedback and build case studies. Develop clear documentation and tutorials. Offer initial incentives (e.g., bonus `STREAM` tokens) to early adopters. |
