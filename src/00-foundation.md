# Foundation of Ethosism

Ethosism is a secular worldview with one practical aim: help people live with purpose, integrity, and long-term responsibility.

This foundation defines the standards used by every pillar in this book. If a belief or behavior cannot pass these standards, it does not align with Ethosism.

## The Core Commitment

Ethosism commits to four non-negotiable commitments:

1. Purpose: live intentionally instead of reactively.
2. Integrity: align values, words, and actions.
3. Long-term responsibility: make decisions that remain defensible across time.
4. Contribution: create value across self, relationships, society, and future generations.

## The Ethical Method

Ethosism evaluates action through objective consequences and reciprocal fairness.

Use this test before major decisions:

1. Reality test: what are the likely real-world effects?
2. Reciprocity test: would this still feel fair if roles were reversed?
3. Integrity test: does this match your stated values?
4. Time-horizon test: will this decision still be wise in 5, 10, or 30 years?
5. Contribution test: does this improve self, relationships, society, or the future?

If an action fails these tests, revise it.

## The Four Contribution Domains

Every pillar in this book should be applied across these domains:

1. Self: character, discipline, capability, and wellbeing.
2. Relationships: trust, loyalty, communication, and care.
3. Society: fairness, competence, service, and institution-building.
4. Future generations: sustainability, legacy, education, and long-term stewardship.

## How to Use This Book

Read and apply pillars as standards of practice, not abstract ideas.

1. Learn the principle clearly.
2. Translate it into daily behaviors.
3. Measure behavior honestly.
4. Correct quickly when you drift.
5. Teach and model the principle for others.

This book is designed to be practical. The goal is not agreement in theory; the goal is disciplined, ethical action over a lifetime.
