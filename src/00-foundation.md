# Foundation - Golden Rule
The foundation of ethosism is the golden rule: Treat others as you would want to be treated by them. Using this guiding principle, we are able to formulate a set of principles that make sense as the north star for humanity.

## Core Principle
Excellence in self directly impacts others. Your personal growth becomes a gift to those around you.

## How do we maintain objectivity with Golden Rule?
The ethosian approach towards maintaining objectivity with the golden rule is having a heightened awareness for the other. This translates to excellence of self - if you aren't striving for greatness, this impacts others.

## Why This Foundation Matters
- **Self-improvement isn't selfish** - It's your responsibility to others
- **Awareness creates compassion** - Understanding others' perspectives drives better decisions  
- **Objectivity through empathy** - The golden rule provides clear moral direction
- **Universal application** - Works across cultures, contexts, and conflicts

## The Ethosian Approach
We write and structure principles to be:
- **Pithy and practical** - Easy to remember and apply
- **Logically connected** - Each principle builds on this foundation
- **Action-oriented** - Clear guidance for daily decisions
- **Universally applicable** - Relevant regardless of circumstances

The golden rule isn't just philosophy - it's a practical framework for building a better world through better individuals.
