# Mentorship

The knowledge you have was not produced by you alone, and you are not entitled to be its last stop.

Whatever competence you have developed — in your work, in how you navigate the world, in the specific domain where you have accumulated genuine experience — came to you through a chain of transmission. Someone taught you, or you learned from watching someone, or you inherited the written thinking of people who worked through problems before you existed. This chain does not end at you by default. Whether it continues depends on whether you make deliberate choices to pass what you carry on to people who are coming behind you.

## What Real Transmission Looks Like

Mentorship is frequently discussed in ways that make it sound more formal and less demanding than it actually is. The formal version — the structured program, the assigned mentor, the monthly meeting with an agenda — exists and has its uses, but it is not where most genuine transmission happens. Genuine mentorship happens in the ordinary moments of working alongside someone: the explanation that goes beyond the immediate task to address the underlying principle, the honest assessment of a decision that a junior person would have been praised for rather than challenged on, the willingness to put your credibility behind someone who has not yet established their own. These are the things that actually develop people, and they require attention, not meetings.

The difference between advising and helping someone grow is the difference between answering questions and asking them. Advising gives the person what they asked for. Mentorship is more disruptive — it requires that you develop a sense of who the person is, what they are capable of, where the edges of their current thinking are, and how to push productively at those edges without simply doing the thinking for them. This is harder than advising. It requires that you be genuinely curious about the person in front of you rather than interested primarily in demonstrating the value of what you know.

## Where Mentorship Fails

What makes mentorship fail is usually one of a small number of things. The mentor who is in it primarily for the satisfaction of having a protégé — someone who confirms their status and reflects well on them — is not doing mentorship. They are doing something closer to patronage, with the attendant expectation of loyalty and the corresponding resentment when the mentee develops views or approaches that diverge from theirs. The mentor who gives advice without accountability — who offers recommendations without following up, who has opinions about decisions they won't be around to live with — is providing input of limited value. And the mentor who cannot tolerate being challenged by someone they are developing has confused the hierarchy with the purpose.

The mentee is not a vessel for your accumulated wisdom. They are a different person in a different context, and what worked for you, in your time, may not be the right approach for them. Part of mentorship is calibrating your experience to their situation, which requires genuine inquiry into what their situation actually is rather than pattern-matching it to your own history.

## Being Mentored Well

Being mentored well is its own skill, and it is underemphasized. The mentee who approaches the relationship passively — waiting to be told what to do, treating the mentor's time as a resource to consume rather than a relationship to maintain — is not actually being mentored. They are being advised, inefficiently. Being mentored well requires that you know what you are trying to develop and can articulate it with enough specificity to make the relationship useful. It requires honesty about where you are actually struggling rather than presenting the version of yourself that is most likely to be approved of. It requires that you take the hard feedback and demonstrate, over time, that the relationship is making you more capable, not just more connected.

## The Obligation to Offer It

The obligation to mentor is not contingent on being asked. Part of what experience provides is the ability to see, in people who are earlier in development, the patterns that you recognize from your own trajectory — the errors you made, the shortcuts that are actually long routes, the places where the obvious approach is wrong in ways that aren't visible yet. When you can see those things in someone who cannot, and you say nothing because they didn't formally request your input, you are being technically respectful while withholding something that would genuinely help them. The obligation does not require that you impose your experience. It requires that you make it available.

What you know is not an achievement to be protected. It is a resource to be deployed, and the most durable deployment is into the development of people who will use it, extend it, and eventually correct it.

That is how competence outlasts the people who first developed it.
