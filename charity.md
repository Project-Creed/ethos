# Charity

## Introduction

Recognizing the vital role of charity in fostering a compassionate and supportive community, this chapter outlines the principles and guidelines for charitable giving according to Maimonides[^1]. Rooted in the belief that helping others strengthens societal bonds and promotes justice, this chapter aims to inspire a culture of generosity and responsibility within our community.

## Principles

**1. Prioritizing Family:** Charity begins at home. We commit to helping our own family members first, including parents, children, siblings, and extended family. This ensures that those closest to us are supported and cared for.

**2. Supporting the Community:** Local support is crucial. After family, our next priority is to help those in our immediate community or neighborhood. By supporting our local community, we create a strong, interconnected support network.

**3. Expanding to the City:** Broader responsibility follows. Once the needs of our family and local community are addressed, we extend our help to those in the broader city or town, fostering a sense of civic duty and shared responsibility.

**4. National Charity:** Nationwide solidarity is important. After addressing local needs, we prioritize helping those in our country, contributing to the welfare of fellow citizens and promoting national unity.

**5. Global Assistance:** Global compassion is the final step. After fulfilling our responsibilities to family, community, city, and country, we extend our help to those in other countries, recognizing our shared humanity and global interdependence.

## Practical Guidelines

**1. Assessing Needs:** We encourage careful assessment of the needs within each priority group. This involves understanding the specific requirements of family members, community initiatives, city programs, national causes, and global efforts to ensure effective and meaningful support.

**2. Allocating Resources:** Resource allocation should be proportional to the needs and proximity of the recipients. More resources should be dedicated to those closest to us, with a tiered approach that ensures support reaches further as local needs are met.

**3. Ensuring Sustainability:** Sustainable charity is key. We pledge to support initiatives that promote long-term self-sufficiency and empowerment, such as education, job training, and small business support, particularly for family and local community members.

**4. Maintaining Anonymity:** When possible, charity should be given anonymously[^2]. This respects the dignity of the recipients and aligns with Maimonides' teaching that the highest form of charity is to give without knowing the recipient and without the recipient knowing the donor.

**5. Evaluating Impact:** Regularly evaluate the impact of charitable actions. We commit to assessing the outcomes of our charity to ensure that it is effective and aligned with the principles of prioritizing family, community, city, country, and global needs.

## Conclusion

In adopting these principles and guidelines for charitable giving, we aim to create a community where generosity and responsibility are paramount. Let this guide us in fostering a culture of support and compassion, where everyone is empowered to contribute to the well-being of others, starting with those closest to us and extending outward to the global community.
