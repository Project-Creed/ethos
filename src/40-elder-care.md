# Elder Care

The obligation to care for those who are aging is not sentimental. It is structural. You were, for a significant portion of your life, entirely dependent on someone else's capacity to show up. What happens at the end of a life is the counterpart to what happened at its beginning, and how you respond to that is a statement about what you believe continuity and obligation mean.

Most people do not plan for this. Aging arrives as a surprise — not because it is unpredictable, but because the human preference for the present is strong enough to defer almost any reckoning with difficulty. And so when a parent begins to fail, when the capabilities that were taken for granted start to recede, the family is usually caught without a structure for it. The crisis becomes the occasion for decisions that should have been made years earlier, and the decisions are made under conditions of stress and grief that make them harder to make well.

The practical consequence of this failure to plan is that the person who is aging loses agency at the moment it matters most. Decisions about care, about housing, about finances, about end-of-life preferences are made by people managing their own fear and grief rather than in a deliberate conversation with the person most affected. The antidote is not complicated: have the conversations early, when they can be had at the table rather than in a hospital corridor. Find out what the person wants. Find out what they fear. Find out what matters to them and what they would not accept. Then honor that.

There is a difference between managing someone's decline and honoring their life. Managing decline is the problem-focused, logistics-intensive version of elder care — the doctor appointments, the medication schedules, the safety modifications to the home. These are necessary. They are not sufficient. A person who is aging is not primarily a logistical problem. They are a person with a history that mostly precedes you, with a accumulated experience that deserves acknowledgment, with the specific losses of age — of peers, of capability, of the future — that require real engagement, not management. The dignity of a person at the end of their life depends substantially on whether the people around them still see them as a person rather than a case.

The weight of elder care falls unevenly, and usually on women, and usually on whoever is geographically closest, and usually without formal acknowledgment of the cost. This is an injustice worth naming and a problem that requires active distribution rather than passive absorption by the nearest available person. If you are not the primary caregiver, the question to ask is not "is everything being handled?" but "who is handling it, and what does that cost them, and what can I do to share that cost?" The answer to the first question being yes is not sufficient information. Someone is carrying something. Whether you participate in carrying it is a choice.

There will be grief involved in caring for someone who is aging, even while they are still alive. The loss is incremental — the loss of the version of them you knew, of the relationship you had, of the future interactions you anticipated. This is a real grief, and it can be acknowledged without being disabling. Naming it as grief rather than frustration or inconvenience is useful. It is also worth acknowledging that the person who is aging is experiencing a version of this loss far more directly than you are. They are losing not just capabilities but their sense of themselves. The care that meets that requires something beyond logistics. It requires presence — the willingness to sit with the difficulty rather than manage it from a distance.

People at the end of their lives often want less than you think they want in terms of activity and provision, and more than you think in terms of being known. The question "what do you need?" is good. The question "tell me about the time when you—" is often better. People who are aging carry enormous amounts of lived experience that rarely gets asked about, because the people around them are future-focused and the person aging is not. The conversation that reaches backward into their life, that treats them as the holder of something worth knowing, is one of the more sustaining things you can offer.

What you give at this stage of a relationship is given freely or not meaningfully at all. The person who receives it is not in a position to reciprocate in kind. That is the nature of the obligation — it is one-directional, and its justification is not in what you will receive but in what was given to you and in what you have decided it means to be a person who does not look away when looking costs something.
