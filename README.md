5. Emphasizes personal and societal growth, ethical behavior, and the pursuit of well-being
6. Encourages critical thinking and adaptability while maintaining core values
7. Seeks to address fundamental human questions about morality, purpose, and the human condition through reason and empirical understanding

# Ethosian 
Someone who follows this Ethosism

This is the core creed. Goal is for this to be the base whereby more concrete creeds can be built out and for people to follow.

Recognition that having a framework for life is good. Have a framework that exists regardless of theological view but still same impact as hell or heaven. Why? Because you are not living up to your potential as pre-scribed by your creed. Now you have a framework for life to live against to keep you as a productive human being. 

Once this catches on, and it becomes generational, then the creed becomes even more important/embedded as you are not living up to what your ancestors want of you. 

# How is this different than Secular Humanism

## Essence of Difference
In essence, Ethosism offers a more structured, universally applicable, and deeply motivational approach to secular living, providing a clear framework that encourages both personal and societal growth while embedding a sense of generational duty and purpose.

Those that prefer Ethosism over Secular Humanism value a structured, motivational framework that offers clear guidance on how to live ethically and purposefully, with a sense of generational responsibility and universal applicability.

### How is This Different from Secular Humanism?

Ethosism shares certain similarities with Secular Humanism, such as its secular nature, emphasis on ethical living, and focus on human potential. However, Ethosism distinguishes itself in several key ways:

1. **Universal Framework:** While Secular Humanism often focuses on individual autonomy and subjective interpretation of ethical principles, Ethosism seeks to establish a more structured, universally applicable framework that transcends individual and cultural variations. It provides a comprehensive guide that can be adopted by anyone, regardless of their background, aiming for a global applicability and resonance.

2. **Deep Motivational Concepts:** Ethosism incorporates concepts that carry profound significance and motivational power similar to religious ideas like heaven and hell, but without supernatural elements. These concepts are rooted in naturalistic principles and are designed to provide a strong incentive for individuals to align with their potential and ethical responsibilities.

3. **Generational Responsibility:** Unlike Secular Humanism, which largely focuses on the present and the individual's moral and ethical development, Ethosism places significant importance on the generational transmission of values. It emphasizes the idea that one’s actions are not just a reflection of personal values but are also a continuation of ancestral expectations, creating a deeper sense of responsibility and purpose that extends beyond one's lifetime.

4. **Structured Creed:** Secular Humanism typically promotes ethical behavior and personal growth but often leaves the specifics of how one should live up to individual interpretation. Ethosism, on the other hand, provides a structured creed—a clear, prescribed way of life—that individuals can follow, offering a more defined path for living ethically and purposefully.

5. **Motivational Impact:** Ethosism is designed to have the same psychological impact and motivational power as religious doctrines, providing clear benchmarks for success and failure that resonate deeply with followers. This helps maintain a strong adherence to ethical principles and personal growth, akin to the way religious beliefs influence behavior, but without reliance on divine judgment or rewards.

6. **Adaptability with Core Stability:** While promoting critical thinking and adaptability, Ethosism maintains a stable core of values that are non-negotiable. This balance allows it to remain relevant in changing times while ensuring that its core principles remain intact, providing continuity and a sense of permanence that is sometimes lacking in Secular Humanism.

In essence, Ethosism offers a more structured, universally applicable, and deeply motivational approach to secular living, providing a clear framework that encourages both personal and societal growth while embedding a sense of generational duty and purpose.
