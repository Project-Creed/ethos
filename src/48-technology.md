# Technology

Every tool ever made was built to extend what a person could do. The tools built in the last two decades are the first ones also designed to extend how long you use them.

This distinction matters more than most people have reckoned with. The hammer, the printing press, the automobile — these are instruments that sit idle until you employ them. The smartphone, the social platform, the algorithmic feed — these are instruments that recruit your attention when you have not called for them. The engineering behind them includes teams of people whose job is to maximize the time you spend engaged with the product. This is not a conspiracy theory. It is a business model, described plainly in the documents and earnings calls of the companies that build these systems. You are not the customer. You are the inventory.

Understanding this is not optional if you intend to use these tools rather than be used by them. The mechanisms are specific. Variable reward — the intermittent delivery of interesting or validating content amid mostly ordinary content — produces engagement patterns similar to slot machines. Notification systems create interruption at intervals that prevent sustained attention from taking hold. Social feedback loops (likes, shares, follower counts) attach self-regard to platform behavior in ways that make disengagement feel costly. The design is not neutral. Every friction point that might encourage you to put the phone down has been studied and reduced.

The practical consequence is not merely wasted time, though that is real. It is the degradation of the capacity for sustained attention itself. Deep work — the kind that produces most of what is actually valuable in intellectual and creative life — requires extended concentration. Interruption-based technology systematically erodes that capacity. The person who checks their phone every few minutes is not just distracted during those minutes. They are training their brain to resist the discomfort of uninterrupted focus, which means every subsequent attempt at deep work is harder. You are practicing fragmentation.

There is also the epistemic problem. Algorithmic content delivery optimizes for engagement, and the content that most reliably drives engagement is content that provokes strong emotional responses — outrage, anxiety, tribal validation. This is not the content most likely to give you an accurate picture of the world. Regular consumption of algorithmically curated information produces a distorted view of what is true, what is common, and what is urgent. People who spend significant time on these platforms become gradually more certain about an increasingly inaccurate picture of reality. This is not their failure of intelligence. It is the system working as designed.

The ethical dimension extends outward. Your attention is the commodity being sold to advertisers. The data generated by your behavior is used to refine systems of influence applied not just to you but to everyone using the platform. By using these systems passively — without deliberate constraint — you are participating in and sustaining an infrastructure designed to harvest human attention for profit at the cost of human capacity for reflection. This is worth naming plainly rather than absorbed as background condition.

What deliberate use looks like is specific to your life, but some principles are consistent. The phone does not belong in the bedroom — the sleep research alone justifies this. Notifications for anything except actual communication from specific people should be off by default, not on. The use of a platform should begin with a clear purpose and end when that purpose is complete, not when the scroll runs out of content. Social platforms used for broadcast and status are a different activity than communication, and conflating them is how you end up spending an hour performing your life for an audience when you meant to send a message.

Technology is not the enemy. The printing press, the bicycle, the surgical robot — the capacity to extend human capability through tools is one of the genuinely great things human beings do. But the question of whether you are using a tool or the tool is using you requires active, honest examination. Defaulting to whatever the device calls you toward is not a choice. It is the absence of one.

Put the phone down. Finish the thought first.
