# Evil Speech

The damage done by careless speech is not minor. It does not feel like a significant act to say something cutting about a person who is not in the room — it feels like conversation, like venting, like the ordinary maintenance of social connection. This feeling is a misperception that enables a great deal of real harm.

The concept of evil speech — what the Jewish tradition calls lashon hara, "the evil tongue" — identifies something that most secular frameworks have been slow to name precisely: that speaking ill of someone, even truthfully, is a moral act with consequences that radiate far beyond the speaker and the moment. When you tell someone something negative about a third person, you change how they see that person, potentially permanently. You cannot unsay it. You cannot unplant the doubt or the judgment in the listener's mind. The reputation damage, the social distancing, the shift in how someone is treated at work or in their community — all of this flows from words you spoke in a corridor, at a dinner table, in a message sent in thirty seconds.

The standards that apply to how you speak about people need to be much higher than most people currently apply. The ordinary social lubricant of gossip — the negative story, the assessment of someone's character, the account of what they did — operates mostly without scrutiny. People share it because sharing it feels bonding, feels like intimacy, feels like being inside information. And it is: it is a bond formed at someone else's expense, an intimacy purchased with another person's reputation. This is worth thinking about clearly.

The tests worth applying before you speak ill of someone are these: Is it true? Is it necessary? Is it the right time, place, and audience? And even if you can answer yes to the first two, the third will eliminate most of what passes for necessary speech about others. Most of what people say about other people when those people are not present is not necessary. It does not lead to any action that helps anyone. It does not protect someone from harm. It is the expression of an opinion that could remain unexpressed at no practical cost, except the cost of the social currency that expression would have produced.

There is a legitimate version of speaking about others' behavior: when it is aimed at actual remedy, when it is directed to someone with the standing and capacity to address the problem, when it is as accurate and fair as you can make it, and when you are not telling anyone who does not need to know. This is not gossip. This is the appropriate use of shared information to address a real problem. The distinction is not always easy to draw in practice, but the intent is the test. If you are speaking about someone to fix something, you are likely in legitimate territory. If you are speaking about someone to be interesting, to process your own feelings at their expense, or to solidify your social position in relation to them, you are not.

Slander — false or misleading negative speech — is a distinct and worse offense, but it gets conflated with gossip in ways that let people off the hook. People tell themselves they are not slanderers because they are not lying, while freely spreading truths that are selected and framed to damage. A true thing can still be used as a weapon. A true thing shared without the context that would make it fair is a distortion. You can destroy a reputation without saying anything technically false, and this is a common form of evil speech that rarely gets named as such.

The discipline of holding your tongue is not primarily about following a rule. It is the expression of a specific stance toward other people: that they deserve to be treated as full persons rather than as material for your conversation, that their reputation is something real and important that you do not have the right to degrade for social benefit, that people who are absent still deserve the representation you would want for yourself.

The practical discipline is a pause: before you say something about a person, ask whether you would say it if they were present. This is not a perfect test — some necessary things can only be said when the person is absent — but it eliminates most of what should be eliminated. The version of yourself that you project in a room full of people is not the only version that matters. What you say when no one is watching, when the person cannot defend themselves, when the only thing stopping you is your own judgment — that version matters equally.

Speak of people as though they will eventually hear what you said. Most of the time, they will.
