# Community

You did not pour the concrete you drive on, and you will not replace it when it fails.

## Resident Versus Member

This is the reality of belonging to a community: you are the beneficiary of an enormous amount of work done by people you will never meet, and you are simultaneously a potential contributor to work that will benefit people not yet born. This is not a metaphor. It is a description of the actual structure of civic life, and most people, most of the time, benefit from it without thinking much about it. The thinking matters because without it, contribution tends not to happen — not out of malice but out of inattention.

The difference between residing somewhere and being part of it is behavioral. You can live in a neighborhood for twenty years and remain a resident — someone who uses its infrastructure, occupies its housing, and draws on its services without adding anything back. Or you can, over the same period, become a person that place depends on in some small way: someone who knows the neighbors, who shows up to things, who takes on the ordinary obligations of local life. These two ways of inhabiting the same physical space produce radically different experiences of it and radically different contributions to it.

## What Community Actually Requires

Community is built from showing up for people who are not currently useful to you. This is the test that separates genuine community from social networking. Social networking — the cultivation of relationships based on their professional or material returns — is a real and legitimate activity, but it is not community. Community requires that you extend yourself to people on the basis of shared location and shared life, not on the basis of what they can provide. The parent at the school meeting whose kid is in a different class. The elderly neighbor whose concerns about the street are not your concerns. The new family who doesn't know yet where anything is. These are the people that community is actually built from.

The obligations created by belonging are not contractual. Nobody is enforcing them. This is precisely why they require some level of deliberate cultivation — because in the absence of enforcement, it is easy to take without giving, and to rationalize that absence as merely not having time. Time is real and finite, but "I don't have time for community" often means "community has not made it onto the list of things I've decided matter." That is a different statement.

## The Minimum Viable Participation

The minimum viable version of community participation is simpler than it sounds. It is being known and knowing others — having enough repeated contact with people in your immediate geography that you have some sense of their circumstances and they have some sense of yours. It is showing up to the things that constitute the civic life of your area: the local meetings, the shared spaces, the collective decisions about what your neighborhood or town is going to do. It is contributing some capacity — time, skill, or resources — to the maintenance of the shared infrastructure you rely on.

## The Failure Mode Worth Naming

There is a specific failure mode worth naming: the person who is deeply invested in large-scale causes — global poverty, climate, systemic injustice — while being completely disengaged from the community immediately around them. These commitments are not in conflict, but the substitution is worth examining. It is psychologically easier to care about people at a distance than to be accountable to the people you share a street with. Abstract solidarity is emotionally available; local obligation is just obligation. Both matter, but the local one is the one most easily avoided.

## Extending Trust Before It Is Earned

Community also requires that you extend trust before it has been fully earned. This is uncomfortable, because extending trust before it has been earned involves risk, and communities are full of strangers. But communities are built precisely through that extension — through the accumulation of small mutual risks that establish, over time, enough evidence of reliability to sustain cooperation on larger things. The community that waits until trust is earned before extending it is waiting for something that cannot arrive by that route.

The question is not whether community is worth the investment. Of course it is. The question is whether you are treating it as an investment at all, or simply drawing down a balance that others have built.
