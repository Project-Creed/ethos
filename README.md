# Ethosian 
Someone who follows this Ethosism

This is the core creed. Goal is for this to be the base whereby more concrete creeds can be built out and for people to follow.

Recognition that having a framework for life is good. Have a framework that exists regardless of theological view but still same impact as hell or heaven. Why? Because you are not living up to your potential as pre-scribed by your creed. Now you have a framework for life to live against to keep you as a productive human being. 

Once this catches on, and it becomes generational, then the creed becomes even more important/embedded as you are not living up to what your ancestors want of you.
