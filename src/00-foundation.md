# Goal of Ethosism
The goal of Ethosism is to use objective reality and the golden rule to determine morality. This 
chapter discusses how we are able to determine objective reality. In addition, further hash out
what the golden rule can be used as a guide for life. So let's start.

# Foundation - Golden Rule
The foundation of ethosism is the golden rule: Treat others as you would want to be treated by them. Using this guiding principle, we are able to formulate a set of principles that make sense as the north star for humanity.

## Core Principle
Excellence in self directly impacts others. In the long term view of humanity your personal growth impacts infinity. Your personal growth should be heavily influenced by how it impacts 
humanity long term.

## Objectivity with Golden Rule?
The Ethosian approach towards maintaining objectivity with the golden rule is having a heightened awareness for the other. Being that how one impacts others is the guiding principle, we are able to assess on a situation per situation basis, objectively what is the right approach. This translates to excellence of self - if you aren't striving for greatness, this impacts others.

## Why This Foundation Matters
- **Self-improvement isn't selfish** - It's your responsibility to others
- **Awareness creates compassion** - Understanding others' perspectives drives better decisions  
- **Objectivity through empathy** - The golden rule provides clear moral direction
- **Universal application** - Works across cultures, contexts, and conflicts

# The Ethosian Approach
With the above golden rule, we can understand the Ethosian approach towards life. Every action in the creed should be made with long term humanity in mind. This gives us as humans an infinite sense of purpose, and guiding light towards principle and cause.

## How We Structure Principles
We write and structure principles to be:
- **Pithy and practical** - Easy to remember and apply
- **Logically connected** - Each principle builds on this foundation
- **Action-oriented** - Clear guidance for daily decisions
- **Universally applicable** - Relevant regardless of circumstances

# Uniqueness Of Ethosism
The golden rule isn't just philosophy, it's a practical framework for building a better world through better individuals. Ethosism therefore isn't just philosophy or even principles, it's a creed for living 
every moment of your life.
