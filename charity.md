# Charity

## Introduction

Recognizing the vital role of charity in fostering a compassionate and supportive community, this chapter outlines the principles and guidelines for charitable giving according to Maimonides[^1]. Rooted in the belief that helping others strengthens societal bonds and promotes justice, this chapter aims to inspire a culture of generosity and responsibility within our community. Charity is not merely a financial transaction; it is an expression of solidarity, empathy, and a commitment to the well-being of others. By practicing charity, we not only assist those in need but also enrich our own lives through the cultivation of kindness and altruism.

## Principles

**1. Prioritizing Family:** Charity begins at home. We commit to helping our own family members first, including parents, children, siblings, and extended family. This ensures that those closest to us are supported and cared for. When we provide for our family, we lay the foundation for a stable and nurturing environment. This principle acknowledges that the strength of our society is directly linked to the well-being of our family units. By addressing the needs of our loved ones, we create a ripple effect of support that extends outward, reinforcing the importance of familial ties and responsibilities.

**2. Supporting the Community:** Local support is crucial. After family, our next priority is to help those in our immediate community or neighborhood. By supporting our local community, we create a strong, interconnected support network. This principle emphasizes the importance of building resilient communities where neighbors look out for one another. Through local charities, food drives, and community events, we can foster a sense of belonging and mutual aid. The strength of our community is a reflection of our collective efforts to uplift one another, ensuring that no one is left behind.

**3. Expanding to the City:** Broader responsibility follows. Once the needs of our family and local community are addressed, we extend our help to those in the broader city or town, fostering a sense of civic duty and shared responsibility. In this stage, our charitable actions contribute to the larger urban environment, addressing issues such as homelessness, education, and public health. By engaging with city-wide initiatives and supporting local government programs, we play a part in creating a thriving urban space where all citizens can access the resources they need to lead fulfilling lives.

**4. National Charity:** Nationwide solidarity is important. After addressing local needs, we prioritize helping those in our country, contributing to the welfare of fellow citizens and promoting national unity. This principle reflects our commitment to the broader societal fabric, recognizing that national prosperity is built on the well-being of all its citizens. By supporting national charities and engaging in advocacy work, we help address systemic issues such as poverty, inequality, and healthcare access. Our contributions at the national level help build a more just and equitable society.

**5. Global Assistance:** Global compassion is the final step. After fulfilling our responsibilities to family, community, city, and country, we extend our help to those in other countries, recognizing our shared humanity and global interdependence. This principle stresses the importance of viewing ourselves as global citizens. By supporting international relief efforts, disaster response, and development programs, we contribute to the global fight against poverty, disease, and environmental degradation. Global charity reminds us that our actions have far-reaching impacts and that we are all interconnected in the quest for a better world.

## Practical Guidelines

**1. Assessing Needs:** We encourage careful assessment of the needs within each priority group. This involves understanding the specific requirements of family members, community initiatives, city programs, national causes, and global efforts to ensure effective and meaningful support. By conducting thorough assessments, we can tailor our charitable actions to address the most pressing issues. This might involve direct communication with recipients, engaging with local organizations, or researching the most effective ways to contribute. A well-informed approach ensures that our efforts are not only well-intentioned but also impactful.

**2. Allocating Resources:** Resource allocation should be proportional to the needs and proximity of the recipients. More resources should be dedicated to those closest to us, with a tiered approach that ensures support reaches further as local needs are met. This practical guideline ensures a structured and equitable distribution of resources. By prioritizing immediate family and then gradually extending our support outward, we can create a balanced approach that maximizes the effectiveness of our charity. This tiered system helps maintain a focus on addressing the most urgent needs first, while still allowing for broader contributions.

**3. Ensuring Sustainability:** Sustainable charity is key. We pledge to support initiatives that promote long-term self-sufficiency and empowerment, such as education, job training, and small business support, particularly for family and local community members. Sustainable charity goes beyond immediate relief; it aims to create lasting change. By investing in programs that empower individuals and communities, we help build capacities that lead to self-reliance and resilience. This approach reduces dependency and fosters a culture of continuous growth and improvement, ensuring that charitable efforts have a lasting and meaningful impact.

**4. Maintaining Anonymity:** When possible, charity should be given anonymously[^2]. This respects the dignity of the recipients and aligns with Maimonides' teaching that the highest form of charity is to give without knowing the recipient and without the recipient knowing the donor. Anonymity in charity helps maintain the self-esteem and dignity of those receiving aid. It eliminates potential feelings of shame or obligation and ensures that the act of giving is purely altruistic. This principle encourages a focus on the act of kindness itself rather than any recognition or reward, fostering a genuine spirit of generosity.

**5. Evaluating Impact:** Regularly evaluate the impact of charitable actions. We commit to assessing the outcomes of our charity to ensure that it is effective and aligned with the principles of prioritizing family, community, city, country, and global needs. Evaluation involves tracking the progress and success of charitable initiatives, gathering feedback from recipients, and adjusting strategies as needed. This ongoing process ensures that our charitable efforts remain relevant and effective. By continuously refining our approach based on outcomes, we can maximize the positive impact of our contributions and stay true to our guiding principles.

## Minimum and Maximum Charity

**1. Minimum Charity (10%):** In accordance with traditional teachings, we establish a minimum charitable contribution of 10% of one's income. This baseline ensures that everyone participates in the act of giving, regardless of their financial situation. By setting aside this portion, we cultivate a habit of generosity and social responsibility. This practice, known as "tithing" in some traditions, helps create a consistent flow of support for those in need while also instilling discipline in personal financial management.

**2. Maximum Charity (20%):** While generosity is commendable, it's important to maintain financial stability. Therefore, we suggest an upper limit of 20% of one's income for charitable giving. This cap helps ensure that individuals do not jeopardize their own financial well-being while helping others. It allows for significant contributions to causes and communities in need, while still maintaining a balanced approach to personal finances. This guideline is especially important for those who may be tempted to give beyond their means, potentially putting themselves at financial risk.

**3. Flexibility within Range:** We recognize that personal circumstances vary, and financial situations can change. Therefore, we encourage individuals to find their comfortable level of giving within this 10-20% range. During times of greater financial stability, one might consider increasing their contributions closer to the 20% mark. Conversely, during periods of financial strain, it's acceptable to adjust closer to the 10% minimum. This flexibility allows for sustainable, long-term charitable practices that adapt to life's changing circumstances.

**4. Quality over Quantity:** While these percentage guidelines provide a framework, we emphasize that the impact and thoughtfulness of giving are just as important as the amount. We encourage donors to research and choose causes that align with their values and have demonstrable positive impacts. Even within the 10-20% range, strategic and well-informed giving can maximize the effect of one's charitable contributions.


## Conclusion

In adopting these principles and guidelines for charitable giving, we aim to create a community where generosity and responsibility are paramount. Let this guide us in fostering a culture of support and compassion, where everyone is empowered to contribute to the well-being of others, starting with those closest to us and extending outward to the global community. By embedding these values into our daily lives, we can build a more just, equitable, and compassionate world, one act of charity at a time. Through our collective efforts, we can make a significant difference, ensuring that the principles of charity become a cornerstone of our society's ethos.
