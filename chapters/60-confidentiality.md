# Confidentiality

When someone tells you something they are not telling everyone, they are not just transferring information. They are transferring trust.

This is the thing that gets lost when people treat confidential information casually — as material for interesting conversation, as social capital to be spent, as context to be passed on because it seems relevant. The information itself may be harmless. The act of sharing it is not harmless, because what was shared was not only the information. It was confidence. And once it is broken, the damage is not to the content but to the relationship, and to the broader network of trust that makes private communication possible at all.

## The Basic Requirement

Confidentiality is simple in its requirement: information given in trust must be treated as such. It may not be shared without permission. It may not be used against the person who shared it. It may not be casually disclosed because the context seems to have changed, or because you have decided the original sharer was wrong to want privacy, or because you think the information would be useful to someone else. The obligation to keep confidence does not expire because you find it inconvenient, and it does not transfer: telling someone else "in confidence" is not keeping the confidence. It is distributing it.

## When Silence Is Wrong

There is a distinction that matters enormously and that people sometimes use to avoid the actual requirement: the difference between secrets that protect people and secrets that protect wrongdoing. Confidentiality is not an absolute. When the information you are holding concerns harm to someone who cannot protect themselves, when silence makes you complicit in ongoing damage, when the secret being kept is not a private matter but a pattern of behavior with real victims — the calculus changes. Keeping a confidence is not always the right thing. But the exception needs to be genuine. It is not "I have decided this information is too interesting to keep" or "I think the person's privacy is less important than someone else's curiosity." It is: keeping this secret is causing harm that disclosure would prevent.

Most of what is told to you in confidence falls nowhere near this threshold. Most of it is personal information — struggles, failures, health matters, relationship difficulties — that people shared because they trusted you. The obligation in those cases is clear. Keep it.

## The Practical Cost Of Breaking Trust

What it costs to break confidence, beyond the specific relationship, is worth understanding. When you become known as someone who does not keep confidence — and this does happen, because disclosures rarely stay private — you lose access. People will not tell you what is real. They will give you the version that is safe to circulate. This is a practical loss in addition to an ethical one: you will operate with less information, less trust, and less access to what is actually happening around you. The short-term return on sharing the interesting thing is almost never worth this, and people who are good at confidentiality are disproportionately trusted with the things that actually matter.

## Professional Confidentiality

In professional contexts, confidentiality carries additional weight because it is often explicitly assumed. Client information, personnel matters, financial details, strategic discussions — these are understood by professional convention and frequently by law to be held in confidence. The standard here is not "would sharing this cause obvious harm" but "was this information shared in a context where privacy was assumed." If it was, you have an obligation. The professional who gossips about clients, who discusses personnel matters casually, who treats organizational information as personal currency — is not just being indiscreet. They are violating a standard their role requires.

The less-discussed dimension of confidentiality is what you do with information you were not explicitly asked to keep but clearly was not meant for you to distribute. Conversations overheard, documents seen by accident, details inferred rather than shared — the spirit of confidentiality covers these too. The test is not "was I explicitly told to keep this secret" but "does this person have a reasonable expectation that I will not share this." If the answer is yes, the obligation applies.

Handle private information as if the trust attached to it were itself what is valuable — because it is.
