# Networking

The word has been so thoroughly colonized by the transactional that it has become almost useless — summoning images of business cards and elevator pitches and the uncomfortable performance of interest in people you are calculating the value of.

What lies beneath the corrupted version is something real and important: the network of relationships through which opportunity, knowledge, trust, and help actually move in the world. These relationships are not built through networking events. They are built through years of being genuinely useful, reliably present, and honest enough that people know what they are getting when they deal with you. The substance of a real professional reputation is almost entirely relational — it is what people say about you when you are not in the room, and that is determined by how you actually showed up for them, not by how effectively you managed their impression of you.

## Reputation Versus Contacts

The critical distinction is between building a reputation and collecting contacts. Collecting contacts is the activity that produces a large address book and very little actual support when you need it. The contacts were made instrumentally, they know it, and they have no particular reason to extend themselves for you when it costs them something. A reputation is different. It accrues through consistent behavior over time — through the work you do, the way you treat people, the help you give that you are not keeping score on. It cannot be manufactured quickly and it is not easily destroyed by bad luck. It is the thing that makes people think of you when something important comes up, not because they owe you but because they trust you.

## Be Useful Before You Need Anything

The principle underneath all of this is simple: be useful before you need anything. Not as a calculated strategy — people can smell calculation — but as a genuine orientation toward professional life. When you encounter someone doing interesting work, engage with it honestly. When you have information that would help someone, share it without making them ask. When someone is looking for a connection you can make, make it. None of this requires grand gestures. It requires the habit of looking for where you can add something before you look for what you can extract.

The long-term value of this is not just transactional reciprocity, though that happens. It is the identity it produces — both in yourself and in how others categorize you. People who are known as genuinely useful, who show up reliably, who operate without hidden agendas, occupy a specific and scarce position in most professional environments. They are trusted by multiple parties. They are consulted rather than ignored. They attract good work and good people because good work and good people want to be around that.

## The Two Failure Modes

There is a failure mode worth examining. Some people are very good at the surface behaviors of good professional relationships — warm, responsive, generous with praise — without the substance underneath. The warmth is real but the follow-through is not. They are available in the easy moments and absent in the demanding ones. This is a long-run liability, because reputations are built in the friction, not in the smooth interactions. What people remember is whether you showed up when it cost you something.

The other failure mode is the person who is genuinely skilled and does excellent work but who treats relationship-building as either beneath them or as a necessary evil to be minimized. The belief that quality of work speaks for itself is true in a narrow sense — people who observe you closely will know the quality of what you do. But the relevant people often do not observe you directly. What they know about you comes filtered through someone else's account, and if you have not invested in those people, the account will be thin. Excellent work that is invisible is worth less than good work that is understood and trusted.

## Maintaining Relationships Over Time

Professional relationships require maintenance. Not intensive, not constant — but regular enough that the connection is live rather than historical. Reaching out only when you need something is extractive and obvious. The rhythm of real professional relationships is more like good friendships: occasional, substantive, not purely functional. How is this going? I read something that made me think of you. I heard you took on something new — how is it?

This is not small talk. It is the activity by which genuine connection is sustained across time, and it is the only reliable foundation for a network that means something.
