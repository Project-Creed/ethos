## Ethosism in One Paragraph

Ethosism is a secular worldview that provides explicit guidance on how to live with purpose, integrity, and long-term responsibility. It combines practical behavioral standards with a broad view of contribution across self, relationships, society, and future generations.

## How It Differs from Secular Humanism

- It is more prescriptive: a defined creed instead of mostly open interpretation.
- It emphasizes generational duty as a core obligation, not just a personal preference.
- It aims for a universal, repeatable framework with clear behavioral expectations.
