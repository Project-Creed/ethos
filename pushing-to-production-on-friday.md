# Guiding Principles for Pushing to Production on Fridays

## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of software development, the decision to push code changes to production on a Friday requires careful consideration and adherence to best practices. This document outlines guiding principles for making informed, responsible decisions when contemplating releases on Fridays within our development and operations environment. While it is personally preferred by some in our team, we recognize that not all people feel the same about Friday deployments. The potential for issues arising over the weekend, when support may be limited, is a valid concern that must be addressed with a strategic approach.

## Principles

### 1. Risk Assessment

Evaluating the scope and impact of code changes is the first and foremost step in determining whether a Friday release is appropriate. It's essential to thoroughly understand what the new code introduces and how it interacts with existing functionalities. Assess potential risks by identifying dependencies that might be affected by the changes. This includes considering both direct dependencies within the application and external services that the application relies on. Furthermore, the urgency and criticality of the release should be weighed; while some updates may be time-sensitive and crucial, others might be better delayed until a more suitable time.

### 2. Comprehensive Testing

Ensuring thorough testing of code changes is non-negotiable. Comprehensive testing covers not only unit tests but also integration and system tests to ensure all components work seamlessly together. Regression testing is essential to identify any unintended consequences that new code might introduce to existing functionality. Additionally, validating the stability of the system in a staging environment that closely mirrors production is crucial. This step helps identify potential issues before they can affect end-users, making it a cornerstone of a reliable deployment process.

### 3. Communication and Transparency

Effective communication and transparency are vital for a successful Friday release. Communicate the release plan to all stakeholders, including developers, operations, and business teams. Clear articulation of the nature of changes and their potential impacts helps set expectations and prepare all involved parties. Maintaining transparent communication channels throughout the process ensures that everyone is aware of the release's status and can respond promptly to any issues that arise. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of shared responsibility and readiness.

### 4. Rollback Plan

Developing a rollback plan is a critical safety net for any release, especially on a Friday. A well-defined rollback plan outlines the steps necessary to revert the system to its previous state if unforeseen issues arise. Ensuring that all team members are familiar with the rollback procedure is equally important; this includes having documentation and conducting drills if necessary. Testing the rollback process in a staging environment confirms its effectiveness and prepares the team to execute it smoothly under pressure.

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

Implementing robust monitoring tools is essential to track system behavior post-release. These tools should be configured to set up alerts that quickly identify and respond to anomalies, ensuring that any issues can be addressed promptly. Establishing a post-release monitoring plan involves continuous observation of the system's performance and user feedback. This proactive approach helps in swiftly detecting and mitigating problems, thereby maintaining the stability and reliability of the production environment.

### 6. Limited Scope Releases

Considering limited scope releases on Fridays can significantly reduce the risk associated with deployments. Prioritize smaller, well-contained changes over large, complex updates. This strategy minimizes the potential impact of any single change and makes it easier to diagnose and fix issues if they arise. Ensuring that releases can be easily rolled back if necessary adds an additional layer of safety, making it a prudent approach for end-of-week deployments.

## Conclusion

In adopting these guiding principles, we aim to strike a balance between the need for continuous delivery and the responsibility to maintain a stable and reliable production environment. By carefully assessing risks, ensuring comprehensive testing, maintaining transparent communication, having a robust rollback plan, implementing effective monitoring, and considering limited scope releases, we can make informed decisions about pushing code changes to production on Fridays. These principles are designed to guide our decision-making process, helping us navigate the complexities of software deployment while prioritizing the stability and reliability of our systems.
