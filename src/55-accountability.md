# Accountability

There is a particular kind of person who is always explaining why things went wrong and never responsible for any of it. The circumstances were unusual. The information was incomplete. Other people failed to do their part. They are sincere in these explanations, which makes it worse.

Accountability is not complicated in principle. It means owning outcomes — not just intentions, not just effort, but results. It means that when something under your responsibility fails, the first question you ask is not what external factor caused this, but what you did or failed to do that contributed. This is not self-punishment. It is accuracy. And it is the only posture from which anything actually improves.

The gap between explaining and excusing is worth examining precisely because it is easy to collapse. Explanation is legitimate and useful — understanding what went wrong, including which factors were outside your control, is essential for learning. The problem is when explanation becomes the primary product. When the goal of the analysis shifts from understanding the failure to distributing responsibility away from yourself. When you are more invested in demonstrating that the outcome wasn't your fault than in understanding what you could do differently. That shift is the moment explanation becomes excuse, and most people make it without noticing.

Real accountability produces specific things. It produces trust — people learn that you can be given responsibility because you will not abandon it when things go poorly. It produces improvement — because you cannot learn from failures you refuse to own. It produces clarity — because teams and relationships where people actually own outcomes do not waste time on the exhausting political work of assigning blame. And it produces a kind of credibility that cannot be faked or shortcut: the credibility of the person who, when something goes wrong, says what they did and what they will do differently, without hedging.

Performative accountability produces the opposite of all of this. It looks like accountability — the right language, the right gestures, the appropriate expression of regret — but its actual function is self-protection. The performative apology that centers the feelings of the person apologizing. The public acknowledgment of failure that carefully omits any structural change. The statement that "mistakes were made" without a clear-eyed account of who made them and why. These performances often succeed in the short term. They satisfy the surface demand. But the people around you are tracking the difference between the performance and the reality, and over time, the gap registers.

The hardest application of accountability is the symmetry requirement: holding yourself to the same standard you hold others. This is where most people fail. We are exquisitely sensitive to failures of accountability in other people and remarkably creative at explaining our own. The colleague who missed a deadline gets judged by the outcome. When you miss a deadline, you are aware of all the contextual factors that explain it. This asymmetry is not just unfair — it is corrosive. It means your standards are not standards at all. They are social pressure applied to other people.

The discipline is to apply the same analysis to yourself that you would apply to someone else in your position. If a colleague had made the decision you made, with the information you had, and produced the result you produced — how would you evaluate it? Would you accept the same explanations you're offering yourself? If not, you have work to do. Not the work of being harsher with yourself — the work of being more honest.

There is also an interpersonal dimension. Accountability is not only something you practice privately. It is something you require in your relationships and structures. A team that tolerates chronic unaccountability — where people consistently fail to own outcomes, where explanation always dominates, where performative acknowledgment substitutes for real change — will underperform indefinitely, regardless of the talent in the room. The willingness to hold people to what they committed to, without cruelty but without softening the reality, is itself an act of respect. It says: I take your capacity seriously. I expect you to do what you said.

The phrase "I was wrong" is not a diminishment. It is one of the more useful things a person can say. It closes the loop. It establishes that you are tracking reality more carefully than you are tracking your own image. It makes the next commitment more credible because the people around you have seen that you will own the result, whatever it is.

Own the outcome. Learn from the failure. Apply the same standard inward that you apply outward. This is not complicated. It is just consistently difficult — which is why the people who do it are worth finding and keeping.
