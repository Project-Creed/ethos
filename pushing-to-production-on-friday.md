# Guiding Principles for Pushing to Production on Fridays

## Introduction

Personally, for us it is preferred. However, we recognize not all people feel the same.

In the dynamic landscape of software development, the decision to push code changes to production on a Friday requires careful consideration and adherence to best practices. This document outlines guiding principles for making informed, responsible decisions when contemplating releases on Fridays within our development and operations environment.

## Principles

**1. Risk Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the scope and impact of code changes.
   - Assess potential risks and dependencies.
   - Consider the urgency and criticality of the release.

**2. Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Ensure thorough testing of code changes.
   - Perform regression testing to identify potential issues.
   - Validate the stability of the system in a staging environment.

**3. Communication and Transparency:**
   - Communicate the release plan to all stakeholders.
   - Clearly articulate the nature of changes and potential impacts.
   - Maintain transparent communication channels throughout the process.

**4. Rollback Plan:**
   - Develop a rollback plan in case unforeseen issues arise.
   - Ensure that all team members are familiar with the rollback procedure.
   - Test the rollback process to validate its effectiveness.

**5. Monitoring and Observability:**
   - Implement robust monitoring tools to track system behavior.
   - Set up alerts to quickly identify and respond to anomalies.
   - Establish a post-release monitoring plan to address any issues promptly.

**6. Limited Scope Releases:**
   - Consider limiting the scope of releases on Fridays.
   - Prioritize smaller, well-contained changes over large, complex updates.
   - Ensure that releases can be easily rolled back if necessary.

## Conclusion

In adopting these guiding principles, we aim to strike a balance between the need for continuous delivery and the responsibility to maintain a stable and reliable production environment. Let these principles guide our decision-making process when contemplating pushing code changes to production on Fridays.
