# Interconnectedness

The story you tell about your life — the one where you worked hard and figured things out — is true. It is also radically incomplete.

This is not an attack on individual effort. Effort matters. The choices you made under pressure, the discipline you built, the relationships you cultivated — these are real, and they are yours. But the scaffolding beneath all of it is largely invisible to you, and that invisibility is worth correcting. Not to diminish what you've built, but to see it clearly.

## The Invisible Scaffolding

Start with the obvious things. The language you think in — you did not invent it. The roads you drive, the infrastructure that delivers clean water to your house, the legal system that makes contracts enforceable and property ownable — none of it was built by you or for you specifically, but all of it is yours to use. The economy that creates the category your skills fit into. The institution that trained you. The person, often unremembered, who first took you seriously enough to invest attention in you. Strip all of that away and ask honestly: what remains?

The more capable you are, the more this question matters. High achievers tend to develop strong narratives of self-reliance, and those narratives are psychologically useful — they sustain motivation and reinforce accountability. But they can also produce a particular kind of blindness: the inability to see that your success required a world organized in ways that made your success possible. Someone born with the same raw capacity into a different set of circumstances — different country, different century, different parents, different moment of luck — would have a different life. This is not a comfortable fact. It is a fact nonetheless.

## Reckoning Honestly with Luck

Luck is the hardest part to reckon with honestly. Not superstition or randomness in the vague sense, but the specific contingencies that shaped your trajectory: when you were born, to whom, with what health, in what economy, in what era. You did not choose any of it. The timing of your birth relative to a technological wave. The mentor who happened to be in the room. The illness you didn't get. The accident that didn't happen. These are not small additions to your story — they are often structurally load-bearing. Acknowledging this does not mean you deserved less. It means the causal story is more complex than individual effort alone can explain.

What does this recognition demand? Two things, primarily: gratitude and responsibility.

## Gratitude and Responsibility

Gratitude is not a feeling you perform. It is a cognitive correction — an accurate accounting of what you owe and to whom. When you understand that your position in the world was built on contributions you didn't make and luck you didn't earn, something shifts. The entitlement that accumulates around success begins to erode. You become capable of a kind of generosity that doesn't feel like sacrifice, because you understand that you are working with resources that were never entirely yours to begin with. Gratitude, properly understood, is not weakness. It is epistemological honesty.

Responsibility follows from the same recognition. If your position was partly enabled by systems, communities, and people that preceded you, then your relationship to those things is not neutral. You are downstream of something. That creates an obligation — not a crushing one, not a debt that can never be repaid, but a directional one. The obligation to not only extract from the systems that made you, but to contribute to them. To be a node in the network that passes something forward.

## The Myth of Self-Sufficiency

Interdependence is not a sentiment. It is a description of how things actually work. Your health depends on other people's decisions about pathogens. Your safety depends on strangers following laws. Your food depends on supply chains involving thousands of people you will never meet. Your ideas depend on the thinkers who built the frameworks you think inside of. The myth of the self-made person is not inspiring. It is just wrong, and acting as though it were true produces a kind of moral narrowness — a contraction of concern to the self and its immediate circle, as though nothing outside that circle contributed to who you are.

Recognizing interconnectedness does not ask you to dissolve yourself into obligation. It asks you to hold both things at once: that you are genuinely responsible for your choices, and that your choices happen inside a web of conditions you did not create. That is not a contradiction. It is the full picture.

The people who see this clearly tend to hold their achievements a little more lightly, give a little more freely, and feel a little less threatened by others' success. That is not a coincidence.
