You probably have fewer real friends than you think, and this is not a failure. It is a constraint.

The word friendship is used to cover a wide range of relationships — from the person you text occasionally and would be glad to see, to the person who would drop what they are doing and come to you in a crisis, and who you would do the same for. These are not the same thing, and treating them as though they are produces a particular kind of confusion about what you have and what you actually need. Real friendship — the kind that involves genuine knowledge of another person, sustained investment over time, and real accountability in both directions — is demanding enough that very few people can maintain more than a handful of such relationships simultaneously.

This is not cynicism. It is a claim about the economics of attention. Real friendship requires that you know someone across time and circumstance — that you have seen them under stress, watched them make decisions, been in the room when things were difficult. It requires that you have extended yourself for them at real cost, and that they have done the same for you, and that this pattern has been established enough times to be reliable. It requires that you be honest with them in ways that acquaintanceship does not — that you say the difficult thing, push back on the self-serving narrative, name the thing they are avoiding. None of this is possible at scale. There are not enough hours.

What distinguishes real friendship from acquaintanceship is not affection. You can feel genuine warmth toward many people. It is not enjoyment — you can have excellent evenings with people you are not actually close to. The distinction is mutual knowledge and mutual accountability. Do they know the real version of you, including the unflattering parts? Do you know them that way? Would you tell them something they don't want to hear? Would they tell you? These are the conditions that make friendship load-bearing in a life — capable of providing support that goes beyond social pleasure.

Friendship deteriorates without maintenance, and this is not a metaphor. It is a description of what happens to knowledge of another person when that knowledge is not updated. People change, and if you are not in regular enough contact to track the changes, your model of who they are becomes progressively less accurate. The person you are friends with, in the absence of contact, is increasingly a version of them from the past — a memory rather than a person. Relationships that have survived long gaps often have to be rebuilt partly from scratch, which is possible but requires acknowledging that the gap produced real distance.

Maintenance does not require constant contact. Some friendships can sustain longer intervals than others, depending on the density of the shared history and the compatibility of the communication styles. But maintenance requires enough regularity that the knowledge remains current and the sense of obligation remains active. The friend you speak to twice a year in moments of crisis, and not at all in between, is not a maintained friendship. It is a dormant one — possibly revivable, but not currently functioning as the thing it claims to be.

The investment that genuine friendship demands is real and should not be minimized. You are committing time, emotional energy, and honesty to another person on an ongoing basis, with no guarantee of return and no formal obligation to continue. This is a significant commitment, which is part of why most people have few genuine friendships and should not expect otherwise. The solution to having fewer close friendships than you would like is not to dilute the category until more relationships qualify. It is to be deliberate about where the investment goes.

Making new close friendships in adulthood is harder than it was in early life, and the difficulty is structural rather than personal. The conditions that produce friendship — repeated, unplanned contact over extended time, in low-stakes environments where character can be observed — are abundant in childhood and school and decrease markedly after. This does not mean adult friendship is impossible. It means it requires more intentionality, more willingness to extend yourself before the relationship has proven its worth, and more patience with the slow pace at which genuine closeness develops between adults who already have full lives.

The people who know you well are not a luxury. They are part of the infrastructure of a serious life.
