# Leadership

People follow behavior, not titles.

## Authority Versus Credibility

This is the thing that organizational charts obscure and that experience eventually makes undeniable. Authority can be conferred by a hierarchy. Credibility cannot. Credibility is earned through consistent demonstration over time — through doing what you say you will do, through being honest when honesty is costly, through showing in the actual conduct of your work what you actually believe. The person who has this is a leader regardless of their position. The person who lacks it is a manager, at best, regardless of their title.

The confusion between authority and credibility produces most of what is wrong with how institutions are run. Authority gives you the power to require compliance. Credibility gives you the ability to produce genuine effort. Compliance and genuine effort look similar in good conditions. In hard conditions — in crisis, under uncertainty, when the required thing is difficult and the consequences of cutting corners are not immediately visible — they diverge completely. You get what your actual credibility has earned, which is often significantly less than the authority would suggest.

## Trust Is Built in Ordinary Moments

Leadership is frequently described in terms of vision — the capacity to see a direction and communicate it compellingly. This is real but it is overemphasized relative to something more basic: the capacity to be trusted. People will follow an imperfect direction if they trust the person setting it. They will undermine a correct direction if they don't. Trust is built not through grand gestures but through the accumulation of ordinary ones — the meeting where you told the truth when it would have been easier to avoid it, the commitment you kept when keeping it was inconvenient, the time you took responsibility instead of distributing it downward.

## The Only Form That Compounds

Leading by example is not a tactic. It is the only form of leadership that survives scrutiny. Every other approach — leading by charisma, by force, by incentive — works until the conditions change or the proximity ends. People who were led by charisma will follow until the charisma fades or the cause turns. People led by force will stop the moment force is withdrawn. People led by example continue the behavior after you leave, because they have internalized the principle behind it, not just the behavior itself. This is the difference between compliance and formation, and it is the only form of influence that compounds.

The hardest part of leading by example is that it requires you to maintain your standards in conditions where maintaining them is costly and no immediate audience is watching. The integrity that appears when it is publicly visible is not integrity — it is performance of integrity, and people sense the difference. The real thing is what happens when the cost is private and the credit is deferred or absent. This is also where most leadership actually occurs, in the ordinary decisions that are never seen directly but that collectively produce the culture that everyone experiences.

## What You Tolerate Becomes the Standard

The relationship between a leader and the people they lead is not symmetric, and pretending it is generates specific problems. The leader has more power, which means the obligation to use it with care falls primarily to them. The culture of a team, an organization, or a community is downstream of what the person with the most authority demonstrates is acceptable. What you tolerate — the behavior you walk past without responding, the standard you let slip because addressing it is uncomfortable — becomes the new baseline. This is not a warning. It is a description of a mechanism.

## Developing Others

Good leadership also requires the willingness to develop other people even when developing them creates competitors. The leader who hoards expertise, who is opaque about their reasoning, who makes themselves indispensable by ensuring that no one else can do what they do — that person is protecting their position at the expense of the institution and everyone in it. The most durable measure of a leader's quality is what the people around them became.

The question is never whether you have formal authority. The question is whether the people around you are better for your presence, over time. If they are, you are leading. If they are not, the title is beside the point.
