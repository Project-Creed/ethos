# Respect

There is a distinction that most people blur, and the blurring costs them more than they realize: the difference between respecting a person and approving of their choices.

Respect, at its foundation, is not earned. That is the version of respect that functions as esteem — the higher regard you develop for someone who has demonstrated judgment, integrity, or excellence. That kind is earned and should be. But beneath it, there is another kind: baseline dignity, the minimum acknowledgment that another person is a full human being with standing and interiority. This version is not conditional. It is not contingent on agreement, on behavior, on liking someone or endorsing what they do with their life. It is owed.

The conflation of these two kinds of respect creates a specific problem. When people treat earned esteem as the only kind of respect that exists, they construct a framework in which contempt for people they disagree with is perfectly justified — even appropriate. They are not withholding unearned esteem. They are withholding basic human acknowledgment. These are not the same thing, and the latter is corrosive in ways the person practicing it often does not see.

Disrespect corrodes even when it feels justified. This is worth sitting with. The feeling of justification is very available when it comes to contempt — there is almost always something you can point to as the reason. But the justification does not change what disrespect does to an interaction, to a relationship, to the environment you are in. When you communicate to someone that you consider them beneath serious engagement — through tone, through dismissiveness, through the specific quality of not actually listening — you have closed the interaction to any real outcome. You have also revealed something about your own operating assumptions: that the only people worth treating well are the ones who already deserve it by your accounting.

The practical case for baseline respect is not primarily about being nice. It is about what you can learn and accomplish when you do not start from contempt. Contempt is cognitively expensive. It requires you to maintain a category of people whose perspectives you have decided in advance are not worth attending to, and then to police that category against incoming evidence. People who extend baseline respect to a wider range of people — including those they disagree with, including those they find genuinely difficult — have access to more information, more range of perspective, and more productive conflict than those who do not.

Respecting a person does not require respecting every choice they make. You can hold someone's basic dignity fully intact while also believing they are wrong about a thing, or making a poor decision, or holding a view you find mistaken. In fact, taking someone's position seriously enough to actually engage with it — rather than dismissing it — is itself a form of respect. The willingness to say "here is why I think you are wrong" rather than "you are the kind of person who thinks this way" is not only more civil. It is more honest, and more likely to produce anything useful.

The floor is non-negotiable. How you treat the service worker, the administrative assistant, the person with no status in the room — this is the diagnostic data, not how you treat the person with power over you. Status-contingent respect is not respect. It is strategy. Real respect operates the same way regardless of who is watching or what the other person can do for you.

Respect as a floor also means you do not engage in certain behaviors regardless of whether you feel justified. You do not humiliate people. You do not speak about people in ways that deny their full humanity. You do not use information about someone's vulnerabilities to harm them. These are not limits you observe because you are certain the other person deserves them. They are limits you observe because of what kind of person you are. The line between justified disrespect and cruelty is much thinner than it appears from the inside.

The ceiling — earned esteem — is a separate matter. Admire what is admirable. Hold in high regard the people who have demonstrated the things you value. Let that esteem be earned and calibrated and honest. But keep it clearly separate from the floor, which does not move.

Treat people as full human beings. Not because they have earned it. Because you have decided to be someone who does.
