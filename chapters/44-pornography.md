# Pornography

The brain does not distinguish between a simulation of desire and desire itself — it responds to the image the same way it responds to the reality, and this is precisely the problem.

This is not a chapter written from squeamishness or religious discomfort. The concern here is practical and grounded in what repeated pornography use actually does to the systems that govern attention, arousal, and intimacy. If you want to understand your own desires clearly and sustain real relationships, this matters. Not because the content is sinful, but because the mechanism is corrosive.

Start with what the brain does. Sexual arousal triggers dopamine release in patterns similar to other reward-seeking behavior. Pornography, because it is novel on demand, delivers these signals at a rate and intensity that no natural relationship can match. The consequence is not abstract. Over time, the threshold shifts. What was arousing becomes ordinary. The search for novelty intensifies. Real intimacy — which involves another person with their own rhythms, constraints, and lack of choreography — begins to feel comparatively dull. This is not a moral judgment. It is a neurological description of what habituation does to reward systems. You are recalibrating your desire away from reality.

The second effect is perceptual. Pornography presents an edited, directed, performed version of sexuality. Sustained exposure trains perception — what bodies should look like, what responses are expected, how sex should proceed. These are not neutral lessons. They produce a template that real partners cannot and should not be expected to match. The damage is not always dramatic. It often presents as a quiet dissatisfaction, a subtle sense that the real thing is somehow insufficient. That is the template at work. And it runs in both directions: it distorts how you see your own body and how you see your partner's.

The intimacy effect is less discussed but more significant. Real sexual connection involves vulnerability, reciprocity, and the ongoing negotiation of two people who exist outside the bedroom as well. Pornography is the opposite of this. It is frictionless, undemanding, and private. Regular use trains a particular kind of engagement — one where desire has no social dimension, no risk, no real other. What this does, over time, is erode the capacity for the more complicated and more rewarding version. You do not strengthen a muscle by replacing it with a machine.

None of this is a claim that viewing pornography once, or occasionally, triggers irreversible harm. The research on compulsive use is more definitive than the research on light use. But "it probably does not ruin you if you barely do it" is a poor argument for a practice with clear mechanisms of harm at higher doses, especially when those doses are the norm among regular users. The platforms are designed for escalation. Novelty-seeking is built into the reward system. Moderation is possible but not the direction the medium pulls.

The ethical dimension extends beyond personal harm. The production of pornography involves real people in conditions that range from exploitative to severely harmful. This is not universally true — the range of production is wide — but choosing to not examine the provenance of what you consume because examining it would be inconvenient is itself an ethical failure. You do not get to benefit from an industry's products while declining to know what the industry does. The same logic that applies to fast fashion or conflict minerals applies here. Willful ignorance is not innocence.

The case for abstention is not about purity. It is about protecting the quality of your own desire, maintaining an accurate perception of real people, sustaining the conditions for genuine intimacy, and refusing to participate in a supply chain without first accounting for it. These are practical and ethical reasons, not prudish ones. You can hold this position without condemning others who reach different conclusions, but you should hold it with honest reasoning, not avoidance.

The question worth sitting with is simple: what does this habit do to the life you are trying to build? If the answer requires you to not look too closely, that itself is an answer.
