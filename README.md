# project-creed

This is the core creed. Goal is for this to be the base whereby more concrete creeds can be built out and for people to follow.

Recognition that having a framework for life is good. Have a framework that exists regardless of theological view but still same impact as hell or heaven. Why? Because you are not living up to your potential as pre-scribed by your creed. Now you have a framework for life to live against to keep you as a productive human being.
