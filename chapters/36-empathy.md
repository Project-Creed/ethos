# Empathy

Empathy is not feeling sorry for someone. That is pity, and it is an essentially different act — one that positions you above the person you are observing, looking down at their misfortune with the comfortable feeling of being unaffected by it.

Empathy is understanding an experience from inside it. Not imagining how you would feel in someone else's situation, which is the most common error — that only tells you about yourself. Real empathy asks: given who this person is, given their history and their fears and the specific way they process the world, what is this experience like for them? It requires stepping outside your own interpretive frame and trying to inhabit someone else's. This is genuinely difficult, which is why most people do not do it, even when they believe they do.

## The Most Common Error

The difference matters practically. When you project your own emotional response onto another person's situation, you give them what you would need, not what they need. You comfort them in the way you want to be comforted. You solve the problem you would want solved. You miss the actual person entirely while performing care. And because it looks like care, neither party often notices — until the person being "comforted" feels somehow more alone than before.

The entry point for real empathy is curiosity. What is this like for you? What part of it is hardest? What do you need right now? These are not rhetorical questions. They are requests for the specific information that allows you to actually respond to the person rather than to your projection of them. Most people skip this step because they think they already know the answer, or because asking feels awkward. Both of these instincts should be overridden.

## Empathy Does Not Suspend Judgment

Empathy is also not the suspension of judgment. This is a confusion that has done real damage to the concept. Some people treat empathy as the requirement to validate every experience, endorse every behavior, and withhold all evaluation in the name of understanding. This misreads what empathy is for. You can fully understand why someone does something — the pressures they were under, the history that shaped their response, the logic of their choices from inside their situation — and still conclude that the behavior was wrong, or harmful, or needs to change. Understanding is not absolution. Empathy without judgment is not wisdom. It is the abdication of it.

## Where Empathy Gets Weaponized

The weaponization of empathy is worth naming. Empathy can be demanded as a way of disabling accountability. A person who has caused harm may redirect attention to their own difficult feelings, requiring you to empathize with the perpetrator rather than address the harm. This is not a request for genuine understanding — it is a move designed to forestall consequence. The requirement that you empathize with someone before holding them accountable is, in many situations, a manipulation. Empathy is a tool for connection and understanding. It is not a prerequisite for maintaining standards.

There is another distortion worth watching: empathy that is performed rather than felt. The language of empathy has become fluent in professional and therapeutic contexts, which means it can be deployed convincingly as performance. The correct words are said, the correct posture assumed, the validation delivered — and none of it is actually grounded in genuine interest in the other person. Most people can feel the difference when they are on the receiving end, even if they cannot articulate it. Performed empathy is hollow in a way that lands. The recipient knows they have not been seen, even if they cannot explain why.

## Why It Matters In Practice

What genuine empathy does is relational infrastructure. It is the thing that makes conflict navigable, that allows feedback to be received without defensiveness, that keeps relationships from calcifying into transactional exchanges between people who stopped being curious about each other. You cannot maintain a serious relationship with a person you have never actually tried to understand. You can maintain a cordial one, a functional one, even a long one — but not a serious one.

The practice is simple and difficult: before you respond to a person, try to understand them. Not to agree with them, not to endorse their position, but to genuinely grasp what they are experiencing and why. This slows you down in ways that are inconvenient and produces understanding that makes you more useful and more honest.

To be known is among the deepest needs a person has. Empathy is the capacity to offer that to someone else.
